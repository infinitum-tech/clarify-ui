# Clarify UI #
Clarify UI has three types of user interface components: CSS classes to add styling to existing HTML elements, javascript functions to create UI elements, and javascript functions to simplify other user interface design. 

Clarify UI is lightweight, with no external dependencies.

Clarify UI also has support for dark and light themes by including the appropriate CSS file.
