# Clarify UI #
A set of javascript and CSS libraries for simplifying UI design.

Clarify UI has three types of user interface components: CSS classes to add styling to existing HTML elements, javascript functions to create UI elements, and javascript functions to simplify other user interface design. 

Clarify UI is lightweight, with no external dependencies.

For documentation, see the [wiki](https://github.com/infinitum-tech/clarify-ui/wiki).
